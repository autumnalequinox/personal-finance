#Year 1
##Starting Date
First day of job: July 1 2017

##Gross Income for Year
I will be working for IBM as a software engineer in Austin, TX. My starting salary will be $88k annually. I will also a recieve a $3k signing bonus my first year. My parents have offered me a lump sum of $18k upon graduation to help pay for a car. I will also be coming into an inheritance when I am 23 of $15k. Out of this amount, $91k will be taxable, and $35k will not be.

##Saving and Financial Goals
The following are my saving goals, ranked by priority:
1. Begin contributing 10% of my pre-tax salary to a 401k plan for which I will recieve a 6% match from IBM.
2. Build an emergency fund of approximately $30k, which will cover a years worth of living expenses. I will use the money from my parents and inheritance to immediately build that.
3. Save for a down payment on a home. I intend to rent as cheaply as possible, and put the difference of my budgeted rent costs and my actual rent costs directly into savings for a down payment, as well as splitting the anticipated surplus in my budget evenly between this and my following goal. I would like to be able to apply for a mortgage within 5 years.
4. Save for graduate school tuition. I am considering getting an MBA through UT Austin's Evening MBA program, which would allow me to work full time while working towards my degree. However, it costs approximately $15.3k per semester, or $46k annually, for 7 semesters, and I would like to have at least a year's worth of tuition costs saved before applying.

##One-time costs
I will need to purchase a new laptop, for which I will have a $2k budget. As well, I will have a $3k furniture budget. This will be covered partially by my $3k signing bonus, which will be closer to $2.25k after tax, and $3k of my inheritance. I also intend to adopt 2 kittens through Austin Pets Alive. The adoption fee will be $130 per kitten, and will cover spay/neuter and initial vet fees. As well there will be a few small initial food and supplies costs. The total amount will probably budget to $500 in initial costs outside of the already-budgeted monthly ongoing costs. 

##Housing and Utilities
In my budget, I have allocated no more than 25% of my after-tax and after automatic 401k contributions salary towards rent, which means I have an upper limit of approximately $1.25k monthly. However, I intend to live with at least 1 roommate, and thus may be able to realistically pay between $500 - $800 a month in rent. This would allow me to save approximately $700 a month and $8.4k annually towards my down payment goal just from cutting my living expenses. I have budgeted $200 a month for utilities, defined as water, electric, gas/propane, and trash, based on research of average prices in the area.

##Transportation
I intend to purchase a used Toyota Prius. I
